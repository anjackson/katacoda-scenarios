First, we need to install Warcat.

##Â Installation

You can install Warcat with the following command. Like all the commands in this tutorial, you can just click it and it will start running in the Terminal view to the right:

`pip3 install Warcat`{{execute}}

### Check it's working

Once it's installed, you can check it's working by looking at the command-line options:

`python3 -m warcat -h`{{execute}}
