Now Shine is up and running, you can use it by clicking here:

<div class="center-align">
    <a class="btn-small" href="https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/shine">View Shine User Interface</a>
</div>

From here you can:

* Click the `Search` tab (at the top) and enter a search query, like `mona` (or even `*:*` to match all results).
* Filter those results using search facets (n.b. there are optional facets that can be added if needed).
* See the highlighted text fragments that match your query.
* Click the result title to be taken to the playback URL for that resource.
* Use the `Trends` tab to visualise terms over time (only really useful with more data!)

By default, search results link to [the Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) but it's possible to configure Shine to refer to any Wayback-compatible service.
