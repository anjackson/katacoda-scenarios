Now you've got everything up and running you should be able to use the tabs to the right to switch between the terminal and the various user interfaces.

Why not try:

* Comparing how Shine and Warclight present the the same queries.
* Comparing different features presented by Shine and Warclight.
* Exploring the raw data using the Solr UI.
* Downloading and indexing one or more additional WARCs, via the Terminal.

Have fun!
