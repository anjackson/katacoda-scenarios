Now Warclight is up and running, you can use it by clicking here\*

<div class="center-align">
    <a class="btn-small" href="https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/">View Warclight User Interface</a>
</div>

From here you can:

* Use the `Search` box to enter a query, like `mona` (or even `*:*` to match all results).
* Filter those results using search facets.
* See thumbnail previews of image search results.
* Control which fields are considered when you enter your search query (All text, or just the title/content/URL/host).
* Click through to a detailed result page, summarising the data for that archived resource and linking to the live site and archived playback URL.

Like Shine, search results link to [the Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) by default, but this can be changed as needed.
