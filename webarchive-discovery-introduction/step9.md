Now Warclight is up and running, you can use it by clicking here:

<div class="center-align">
    <a class="btn-small" href="https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/">View Warclight User Interface</a>
</div>

From here you can:

* Use the `Search` box to enter a query, like `mona` (or even `*:*` to match all results).
* Filter those results using search facets.
* ...TBA...
